#### _Week 8 project by: **Matt Nardoni**_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Description
This project is supposed to be a freelancing website pulling inspiration from https://www.freelancer.com/. Using Angular components, the app should have a similar look and functionality to the freelancer home page.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
